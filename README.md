# README

These are CSV files for Anki. Getting data in and out via the Anki application is inefficient, tracking changes even more so. Anki imports from and exports to CSV, so both problems are easily solved.

Each subdirectory contains the CSV and header file for a deck. The header file is for reference only--Anki doesn't use it. The default deck type is Basic, with two fields: Front and Back. The type for any deck is described in the header file.
